# Sim-Racing-Arduino-Shifter
Code for Arduino Pro Micro to act as a USB joystick for a sim racing shifter.

The code is for the H pattern sim shifter
by Noctiluxx (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1274947), with a lower frame by zhxf to have 7 gears + reverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2492486). 

it will work with any other model too though.

for the arduino pro micro, the limit switch for the gears are to be connected as follows:

NC pin of the switches to the pins 2-9 on the arduino 
COM pin of the switches to ground
